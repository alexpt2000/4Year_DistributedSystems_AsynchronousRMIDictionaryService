# 4Year Distributed Systems  - Asynchronous RMI Dictionary Service

# DESCRIPTION

Multi-threaded file server and logging application that allows a client application to download files using a set of options presented in a terminal user
interface:

The Package (oop.jar) contains a Server and Client.



# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

## CEATING JAR FILE

You can create the JAR file using Ant or with the following command from inside the "bin" folder of the Eclipse project:

```
jar â€“cf oop.jar *
```


## STARTING THE SERVER:

```
java -cp oop.jar ie.gmit.sw.server.Server 7777 /serverFiles
```
Can pass arguments:
* Port number (7777).
* Path file location (/serverFiles).


## STARTING THE CLIENT:

```
java -cp oop.jar ie.gmit.sw.client.Client
```

No arguments, default port in 7777.

To run Client, the config.xml file must be present.

### config.xml

```
<client-config username="gmit-sw2016">
	<server-host>127.0.0.1</server-host>
	<server-port>7777</server-port>
	<download-dir>C:/Users/User/Downloads/</download-dir>
</client-config>
```

## WORKING OF THE SERVER:
=========================

Every New Packet received by the server, along with information of the corresponding client, is stored in a data structure 'Request' and directly passed onto a new thread and continues to listen on the port (7777).

The Server keeps all information about the Client's actions in a log.txt file
